    <h1>It Doesn't Matter How It Ends</h1>
    <h2>April 4, 2020</h2>
    <p>One of the struggles I have encountered in attempting to live a good life has been to define what that really is. Is a good life one of relaxing and leisure and enjoying the moment, or is a good life one in which we push ourselves to peak to the highest capacity of what man can achieve? Is the enjoyment in the leisure or the discipline?</p>

    <p>This question came up in a fashion in the early morning when talking with my partner about our thoughts on life after death. I have a more “spiritual” view on the matter and view being in a three-dimensional body an experience that we chose to undergo, while he is a staunch atheist and feels life is simply what is what it is, and upon death we cease to be.</p>

    <p>It occurred to me while we were discussing our different philosophical views, however, that the answer to my question is the same no matter what beliefs we have about life after death: ultimately, it does not matter to anyone but you. It is a choice you have to make, and is likely a little bit of a mixture of both. It is important to grow, just as much as it is important enjoy the present. And I hypothesize that it will continue to be the struggle for each individual man to make the decision about to what extent to follow each of these pursuits.</p>
