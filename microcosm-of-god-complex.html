    <h1>Microcosm of God Complex</h1>
    <h2>April 5, 2020</h2>
    <p>At the time of writing this, we are currently in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. People are locked indoors and are forced, many perhaps for the first time, to face themselves and make a mental evaluation of their ideals and beliefs.</p>

    <p>An overarching theme that has come from this is control, or the lack thereof. As I discussed with my partner’s mother her fears about the virus and in particular getting her family sick, I have been presented with fallacy of the God Complex and humanity’s hubristic nature.</p>

    <p>This essay is not written to bash on his mother, or anyone in particular. We all suffer from the God Complex in various forms.</p>

    <p>The God Complex is the belief that we have more control over the “how” than we actually do. We have a narrow view of how reality works (never mind the infinite possibilities of being due to random chance, God, however you view it) and hold onto the belief that if we take particular steps, we will always get a specific end result.</p>

    <p>And this is true to some extent. I am not including the hard math and sciences in this discussion. If you add 2 + 2, you will get 4.</p>

    <p>What I am discussing is more subjective experiences with multiple factors. If you exercise and eat a low-calorie diet, you will probably lose weight. If you wash your hands and limit exposure to others, you will probably not get the Coronavirus. But it is not guaranteed.</p>

    <p>But the part that we do not like to think about, and the part that strikes so much fear into the hearts of man, or my partner’s mother, is that we cannot control everything. If you are on a particular medication, it may not matter how little you eat, you will gain weight. Even if you practice social distancing, the grocery store bagger may not have washed their hands before handing you your receipt, and you may get sick. There is only so much that we can control.</p>

    <p>So what does one do in the face of this lack of control? You could, as so many people, decide to take an authoritarian route. You can tell others why you are right, they are wrong, and try to force them to agree with you and do things your way. But that does not ease the true fear – control of man’s actions does not control their beliefs. You will live in an uneasy simmer of disagreement.</p>

    <p>Or you could accept your limited ability for control. For the atheist, you can acknowledge that life is random, sometimes bad things just happen, and simply try to enjoy the good that you do have. For the spiritually-inclined, you can feel secure in knowing that everyone’s experiences with God are their own, and you are not responsible for anyone else’s but your own. You can chose to be humble – and perhaps relax a little in the knowledge that things outside of your individual actions are not your problem.</p>
